# LibPrint
LibPrint is a pair of software systems intended to act as a “middleman” between users
attempting to print a document and staff members who will request payment and confirm the
print action. On the client side, the software should act as a printer driver so that users will
simply have to select LibPrint as their printer and click print. The document will then be sent to
the host-operated webclient where a staff member can print the document normally.
